* Building applications with OpenShift

  We created a _very_ simple Quarkus (java) application that we would
  like to build with the help of OpenShift. The application provides a rest endpoint
  for listing pod objects.

  Execute the following command:

  #+begin_src sh
oc new-app registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11~https://github.com/rhatservices/openshift-quarkus-example.git -l openshift-example=yes
  #+end_src

  Closely watch the generated output:

  #+begin_src
--> Found container image a9937ea (4 weeks old) from registry.access.redhat.com for "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11"

    Java Applications
    -----------------
    Platform for building and running plain Java applications (fat-jar and flat classpath)

    Tags: builder, java

    * An image stream tag will be created as "openjdk-11:latest" that will track the source image
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/rhatservices/openshift-quarkus-example.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "openshift-quarkus-example:latest"
      * Every time "openjdk-11:latest" changes a new build will be triggered

    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f buildconfig/openshift-quarkus-example' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/openshift-quarkus-example'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
  #+end_src

  Let's check the overall status of our OpenShift project:

  #+begin_src sh
oc status
  #+end_src

  You can see the current builds with

  #+begin_src sh
oc get builds
  #+end_src

  Details are available with

  #+begin_src
oc describe builds openshift-quarkus-example-1
  #+end_src

  To see the details of the running build execute the following commands:

  #+begin_src sh
oc logs -f openshift-quarkus-example-1-build
  #+end_src

  After the build completes, check which pods are running

  #+begin_src sh
oc get pods
  #+end_src

  If you want to start a new build an follow the logs:

  #+begin_src
oc start-build openshift-quarkus-example --follow
  #+end_src

  Is there a already deployment for this application?

  #+begin_src sh
oc get deployment
  #+end_src

  Lets try to expose our simple service

  #+begin_src sh
oc expose svc openshift-quarkus-example
ROUTE=$(oc get route -o yaml openshift-quarkus-example -o jsonpath={.spec.host})
PROJECT=$(oc project -q)
curl -v "$ROUTE"/pods/"$PROJECT"
  #+end_src

  What is the HTTP status code?

  Is there a hint in the container log?

  #+begin_src sh
oc logs -f -l deployment=openshift-quarkus-example
  #+end_src

  Let's try to fix this:

  #+begin_src sh
oc adm policy add-role-to-user view -z default
  #+end_src

  Now let's try to query our HTTP endpoint again

  #+begin_src sh
curl -v "$ROUTE"/pods/"$PROJECT"
  #+end_src
