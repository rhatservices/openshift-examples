* Building application with OpenShift

  XXX This does not work currently XXX

  We create a _very_ simple quarkus (java) application that we would
  like to build with the help of openshift.

  Execute the following command:

  #+begin_src sh
oc new-app quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-native-s2i:20.3-java11~https://github.com/rhatservices/openshift-quarkus-example.git
  #+end_src
