* This is a very  simple pod

** Check your current namespace

   Before creating objects in OpenShift or Kubernetes you should check
   the current namespace that you are using

   #+begin_src sh
oc project
   #+end_src

** Creating a simple pod from the command line

   #+begin_src sh
oc run -i -t ubi --image=registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi:8.3 --restart=Never
   #+end_src

   -i ... run interactivly
   -t ... allocate a terminal

   When finished delete the pod with

   #+begin_src
oc delete pod ubi
   #+end_src

** Creating a simple pod via a yaml file

   create the simple pod with

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f simple-pod.yml
  #+end_src

   run

   #+begin_src sh
oc get pods
   #+end_src

   to the list of running pods in the current namespace.

** A pod running two containers

   Take a look at advanced-pod.yml. Explain what you see.

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f advanced-pod.yml
  #+end_src

   run

   #+begin_src sh
oc get pods
   #+end_src

   to the list of running pods in the current namespace.
