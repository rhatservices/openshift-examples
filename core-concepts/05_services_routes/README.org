* A full example for exposing an applictation

  In this example we are going to deploy a pod running nginx.

** Step 1: Create a configmap using index.html

   #+begin_src sh
oc create configmap index --from-file=index.html
   #+end_src

** Step 2: Create a new deployment using nginx

   #+begin_src sh
oc apply -f nginx-deployment-cm.yml
   #+end_src

   What kind of resource are created?

   Test the deployment with curl and oc port-forward

   #+begin_src sh
oc port-forward deployment/nginx-deployment 8080:8080
curl localhost:8080
   #+end_src

** Step 3: Create a service for nginx

   #+begin_src sh
oc apply -f nginx-service.yml
   #+end_src

   Can you use curl to access the service?

   What happens if you modify the configmap and curl the service again?

** Step 4: Expose the service

   #+begin_src sh
oc expore svc nginx
   #+end_src

   What kind of resource gets created?

** Step 5: Expose the service via a SSL edge terminating route

   #+begin_src sh
oc create route edge ssl-nginx --service=nginx
   #+end_src

   What kind of resource is created?

   Can you take a look at the details of the resource?
