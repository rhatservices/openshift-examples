  Execute

  #+begin_src sh
oc get storageclasses
  #+end_src

  to get a list of available storage classes

** creating a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

   Take a look at _pvc.yaml_. You have to add the StorageClass you
   would like to use (~mystorageclass~ in the example below):

   #+begin_src yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: test-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: "mystorageclass" # add available storage class here
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce    # could also be ReadWriteMany, talk to you admin if in doubt.
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
   #+end_src

   Select a StorageClas from the list of available classes.

   It is also possible that a default StorageClass is defined. If this
   is the case you can remove the ~storageClassName~ parameter and
   OpenShift will automatically use the default StorageClass. Please
   talk to your beloved OpenShift admin.

   Create the PVC after adding the ~storageClassName~ with

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f pvc.yaml
   #+end_src

** Using the storage class

   _deployment.yml_ contains an example deployment that uses the PVC
   create in the previous example:

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f deployment.yml
   #+end_src
