* Projects and namespaces

  Take a look at you current namespaces/project

  #+begin_src
oc status
  #+end_src

  Which project are you currently using?

  Are there any annotation on your project?

  #+begin_src sh
oc describe project <project name>
  #+end_src

  What is the difference to a namespace?

  #+begin_src
oc describe ns <namespace>
  #+end_src
