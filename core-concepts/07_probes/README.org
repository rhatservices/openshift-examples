* Liveness and readyness probes

** liveness probe in action

  Take a look at the pod definition of [[file:liveness-pod.yml][liveness-pod.yml]]

  What do you expect if you delete _/tmp/healthy_?

  Create the pod with

  #+begin_src sh
oc create -f liveness-exec-pod.yml
  #+end_src

  Look at the pod status especially the liveness check via

  #+begin_src sh
oc describe pod liveness-exec
  #+end_src

  What will happen if you delete /tmp/healthy?

  #+begin_src sh
oc exec liveness-exec -- rm /tmp/healthy
  #+end_src

  Look at the pod status

  #+begin_src sh
oc descibe pod liveness-exec
  #+end_src


** liveness and readyness tcp probe

   Create a pod that implementes a TCP liveness and readiness probe

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f live-ready-probe-pod.yml
   #+end_src

   Describe the pod status

   #+begin_src sh
oc describe pod tcp-live-ready
   #+end_src

   Does the status change over time?

** http probes

   Create a pod implementing HTTP based probes

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f http-probe-pod.yml
   #+end_src

   What is the status of the pods

   #+begin_src
oc describe pod liveness-http
   #+end_src

   Can you fix the pod?
