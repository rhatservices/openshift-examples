* Liveness and readyness probes

** liveness probe in action

  Take a look at the pod definition of [[file:liveness-pod.yml][liveness-pod.yml]]

  What do you expect if you delete _/tmp/healthy_?

  Create the pod with

  #+begin_src sh
oc create -f liveness-exec-pod.yml
  #+end_src

  Look at the pod status especially the liveness check via

  #+begin_src sh
oc describe pod liveness-exec
  #+end_src

  What do you expect will happen after 30 seconds?

    #+begin_src sh
oc describe pod liveness-exec
  #+end_src

  Look at the pod status

  #+begin_src sh
oc descibe pod liveness-exec
  #+end_src

** liveness and readyness tcp probe

   Create a pod that implementes a TCP liveness and readiness probe

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f tcp-probe-pod.yml
   #+end_src

   Describe the pod status

   #+begin_src sh
oc describe pod tcp-probe
   #+end_src

   Does the status change over time?

** http probes

   Create a pod implementing HTTP based probes

   #+begin_src sh
oc create -f http-probe-pod.yml
   #+end_src

   What is the status of the pods

   #+begin_src
oc describe pod http-probe
   #+end_src

   Can you fix the pod?

** Cleanup

   #+begin_src
oc delete pod liveness-exec tcp-probe http-probe

   #+end_src
