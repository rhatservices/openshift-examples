* Pod affinity and anti-affinity

  Deploy a sample pod

  #+begin_src
oc create -f pod-a.yml
  #+end_src

  Check the affinity rules of pod-b and deploy the pod

  #+begin_src
oc create -f pod-b.yml
  #+end_src

  Should the pod be running on the same or on a different node than pod-a?

  Check pod placement

  #+begin_src sh
oc get pods -o wide
  #+end_src

  Check the affinity rules of pod-c and deploy the depod

  #+begin_src sh
oc create -f pod-c.yml
  #+end_src

  Should the pod be running on the same or on a different node than pod-a?

  Check pod placement

  #+begin_src sh
oc get pods -o wide
  #+end_src

** Cleanup

   #+begin_src
oc delete pod-a pod-b pod-c
   #+end_src
