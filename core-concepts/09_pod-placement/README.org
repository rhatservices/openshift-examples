* Pod affinity and anti-affinity

** Use case 1: deploy frontend and backend on the same node if possible

  Deploy the frontend pod

  #+begin_src
oc apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml
  #+end_src

  Check the affinity rules of the backend deployment and apply it

  #+begin_src
oc apply -f backend-deployment.yaml
  #+end_src

  Check pod placement

  #+begin_src sh
oc get pods -o wide
  #+end_src

  Is the backend running on the same node as  the frontend?

** Use case 2: clustered application which must not run on the same node

   Check the affinity rules of the clusterapp-deployment.

   Deploy the cluster application:

   #+begin_src
oc apply -f clusterapp-deployment.yaml
   #+end_src

** Cleanup

   Execute

   #+begin_src
../../utils/cleanup.sh
   #+end_src
