* A full example for exposing an applictation

  In this example we are going to deploy a pod running nginx.

** Deploy nginx

   #+begin_src sh
oc apply -f nginx-deployment.yml
   #+end_src

   What additional resources does to create?

** Delete the pod

   What happens if you delete the nginx pod?

   #+begin_src sh
oc get pods
oc delete pods -l openshift-example=yes
oc get pods
   #+end_src

** Scale the deployment to two

   #+begin_src sh
oc scale --replicas=2 deployment/nginx-deployment
   #+end_src

   What is the state of the replicaset now?

   #+begin_src sh
oc get replicaset
   #+end_src

   How many pods are running?

   #+begin_src sh
oc delete deployment nginx-deployment
   #+end_src

   What happens with dependend objects (replicaset, pods)?

* Cleanup

  Execute

  #+begin_src sh
../../utils/cleanup.sh
  #+end_src
