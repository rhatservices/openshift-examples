* A full example for exposing an applictation

  In this example we are going to deploy a pod running nginx.

** Step 1: Deploy nginx

   #+begin_src sh
oc apply -f nginx-deployment.yml
   #+end_src

   What additional resources does to create?

** Step 2: Scale the deployment to two

   #+begin_src sh
oc scale --replicas=2 deployment/nginx-deployment
   #+end_src

   What is the state of the replicaset now?

   How many pods are running?

   #+begin_src sh
oc delete deployment nginx-deployment
   #+end_src

   What happens with dependend objects (replicaset, pods)?
